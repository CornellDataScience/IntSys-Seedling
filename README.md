Team Members: Katie Yang, Cora Wu, Jenna Kressin, Joe Campbell, [Brandon Kates](https://github.com/BrandonKates)

Our project will include:
 * Classification Model
   * Implementing CNN based classification model to infer seedling species
 * Pruning Stage
   * Analyzing the efficiency of implemented models
   * Reducing computations necessary for classification
 * Mobile Application
   * Build mobile application that supports trained model
